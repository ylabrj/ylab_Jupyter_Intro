    "# Jarduino: Integrating Arduino Development with Jupyter IPython Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Problem - and the Opportunity\n",
    "\n",
    "Integrating Python and Arduino requires separate environments - the Arduino IDE, and, for Python, a simple editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) like Eclipse or Pycharm. Using a single environment would be nice. For a lot of experimentation, integrating it into the Jupyter Notebook would be even better.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebook is dominant in data sciences and machine learning because of it's ability to tie together code, notes, data and results. While not as sophisticated as an IDE, it's overall better because of the ability to keep notes, and to manipulate and lot data with tools like numpy, pandas and matplotlib.\n",
    "\n",
    "Arduino coding consists of (relatively) simpler programs where the Arduino is used as a data collector or as the end point for receiving data/taking action. Complex processing can be passed to a more powerful system for data analysis or to make decisions and pass back an action back to the Arduino. There are Raspberry Pi libraries like __[nanpy](https://nanpy.github.io/)__ to help this integration. The combination of Raspberry Pi and Arduino is popular among robotics developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Web searches for Arduino/Jupyter integration show a lot usage of Arduino data inside Jupyter, but with the Arduino code always external. The code may be shown in the notebook, but always with the caveat *'you need to copy this code to the Arduino IDE to load and run on your board'*.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Why hasn't somebody done something about this?\", I thought, while unfortunately standing in front of a mirror.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this paper, we'll go through the process of how we developed the %%jarduino and %jardutil magics to help manage complex multi-board development of Arduino code. Along the way we'll also show you some tips on how to manage and load Arduino code using only standard Jupyter IPython features.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Design Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "[Jupyter has dozens of language kernels](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels), none of which support Arduino sketches. It's allegedly not too difficult to [create a new kernel for Jupyter](https://jupyter-client.readthedocs.io/en/stable/kernels.html). Arduino sketches are based on C, so using a C kernel, particularly with Jupyter cells supporting the language, could be a starting point.\n",
    "\n",
    "But a goal of the project is to be able to work on Python and Arduino code together. And so we fall into a serious design issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each Jupyter Notebook supports a single kernel - which means a single language. A Jupyter notebook is composed of cells, the main types being __markdown__ for text and images (you are readin a markdown cell), and __code__ for the programs. Code cells are directly tied to the kernel, so in a Python notebook, code means Python. There is no option for other types of code cells in a Python notebook, or for Python code cells in a notebook for another language.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is some healthy debate about this Jupyter development circles. The Jupyter designers' view is that supporting multiple languages is best handled with messaging between different kernels. A big proponent of multi-language notebooks is Bo Peng, the developer of the multi-kernel Jupyter variant __[SoS Polyglot Notebook and Workflow](https://vatlab.github.io/sos-docs/)__ system. You can check out some __[to-and-fro on the topic here](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/2815)__, with each side respectfully covering each other's arguments and views. It's a good read and a nice change from the usual Internet flame wars.\n",
    "\n",
    "But is this complexity necessary for Arduino Sketches?\n",
    "\n",
    "Sketches, regardless of complexity, are relatively limited programs. They are not calling databases or writing to the web. They are not calling the other Jupyter libraries. They are limited by the microcontroller's memory and processing capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Developing and running a sketch requires three things:\n",
    "\n",
    "*  Edit and saving the code\n",
    "*  Running a verify/compile on the code\n",
    "*  Loading the resulting program to the Arduino board\n",
    "\n",
    "If we can accomplish these things and maintain our Python coding ability, we'll meet our goals\n",
    "\n",
    "## The other way of running non-Python code in an IPython notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "In Jupyter's Python cells, support for other languages is often provided by a [*magic*](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html). Magics are macro-like operations written in Python that can perform a utility function independently or using the contents of the cell.\n",
